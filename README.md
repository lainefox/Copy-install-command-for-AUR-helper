# Copy install command for AUR helper
It does what the name implies.
It copies the command to install a package from the AUR with your favorite helper at the press of a link...

### Installation 
1. [Install Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2. [Install Userscript](https://github.com/lainefox/Copy-install-command-for-AUR-helper/raw/main/copy-install-command-for-aur-helper.user.js)

### AUR helpers supported:
- ame _(Amethyst)_
- aura
- aurman
- pacaur
- pakku
- paru
- pikaur
- trizen
- yay
and any other you would like by just adding it to the array...
